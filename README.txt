 # Problem 1 Forest Management
All code is contained in the jupyter notebook ForesetManagement.ipynb 

For this section all graphs were saved from the Jupyter Notebooks

# Problem 2 Frozen Lake
All code is contained in the jupyter notebook Frozen_Lake_Problem.ipynb
The modified Frozen Lake problem is in MyFrozenLakes.py and code implementing the algorithms is in common.py

For this section all graphs were saved from the Jupyter Notebooks

## Python packages
I think the python packages are pretty standard but a requirements.txt file is provided in the repo listing all packages
that were installed when running the code
